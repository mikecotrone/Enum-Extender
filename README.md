# Enum-Extender
A little tool to help write to string &amp; from string extends methods for Enums

Compile a version & you can drag & drop enums from Xojo into the window and it will write extends methods for you to convert the enum values to & from strings (or you can have it write a pair of methods that you can use if you dont want to add a module with extends methods)

A second window lets you quickly write an enumeration in a text area
You can then get a copy put on the clipboard you can paste into Xojo
